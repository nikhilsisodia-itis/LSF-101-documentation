# Introduction

## 1. Linux History

### 1.1 Origin of Linux

- Linux was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 as a free and open-source alternative to the MINIX operating system.
- It was initially developed as a hobby project but quickly gained popularity among developers and enthusiasts.

### 1.2 Evolution of Linux

- In 1992, Linux was re-licensed using the General Public License (GPL) by GNU (a project of the Free Software Foundation or FSF, which promotes freely available software), which enabled it to build a worldwide community of developers.
- Over the years, Linux has evolved significantly, with contributions from thousands of developers worldwide.
- It has become the foundation for many operating systems, including popular distributions like Ubuntu, RedHat, Fedora, and CentOS.
- Linux is now widely used in various domains, including servers, desktops, mobile devices (Android), and embedded systems.

## 2. Linux Foundation

### 2.1 Overview

- The Linux Foundation is a non-profit organization established in 2000 to promote, protect, and advance the Linux operating system and collaborative software development.
- It provides a neutral home for open-source projects and fosters collaboration among developers, companies, and users.

### 2.2 Key Initiatives

- The Linux Foundation supports various initiatives, including the Linux kernel development, open-source projects like Kubernetes, Hyperledger, and the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
- It also offers training and certification programs to help individuals and organizations enhance their skills in Linux and open-source technologies.

## 3. Common Linux Terminologies

### 3.1 Kernel

- The kernel is the core component of the Linux operating system that manages system resources, hardware, and communication between software and hardware.
- It is responsible for tasks such as process management, memory management, and device management.

### 3.2 Distribution (Distro)

- A Linux distribution is a complete operating system built around the Linux kernel, including additional software packages, libraries, and tools.
- Popular distributions include Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, and Arch Linux.

### 3.3 Shell

- The shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by executing commands and scripts.
- Common shells include Bash (Bourne Again Shell), Zsh, and Fish.

### 3.4 Package Manager

- A package manager is a tool that automates the process of installing, updating, and managing software packages on a Linux system.
- Examples of package managers include APT (Advanced Package Tool) for Debian-based systems and YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified) for RedHat-based systems.

### 3.5 File System

- The file system is the method and structure used by the operating system to store and organize files on storage devices.
- Common Linux file systems include ext4, XFS, and Btrfs.

### 3.6 Command Line Interface (CLI)

- The CLI is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by typing commands.
- It is a powerful tool for system administration, scripting, and automation.

### 3.7 Open Source

- Open source refers to software whose source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute.
- Linux is a prime example of open-source software, fostering collaboration and innovation within the community.

### 3.8 Root User

- The root user is the superuser account in Linux with unrestricted access to all system resources and files.
- It is used for system administration tasks that require elevated privileges.

### 3.9 Terminal

- A terminal is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with the shell and execute commands.
- It can be accessed through terminal emulators like GNOME Terminal, Konsole, and xterm.

### 3.10 Daemon

- A daemon is a background process that runs continuously and performs specific tasks or services without direct user interaction.
- Examples of daemons include web servers (e.g., Apache), database servers (e.g., MySQL), and print servers (e.g., CUPS).

### 3.11 Repository

- A repository is a centralized location where software packages are stored and managed for easy access and installation.
- Linux distributions maintain repositories to provide users with a wide range of software options.

### 3.12 Kernel Module

- A kernel module is a piece of code that can be loaded into the Linux kernel to extend its functionality without the need to reboot the system.
- Examples include device drivers and file system modules.

### 3.13 Virtualization

- Virtualization is the process of creating virtual versions of physical hardware resources, allowing multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine.
- Popular virtualization technologies include KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine), VMware, and VirtualBox.

### 3.14 Containerization

- Containerization is a lightweight form of virtualization that allows applications to run in isolated environments called containers.
- Docker and Kubernetes are popular containerization technologies used for deploying and managing applications.

### 3.15 LTS (Long-Term Support)

- LTS refers to versions of software, including Linux distributions, that receive extended support and updates for a longer period compared to regular releases.
- LTS versions are ideal for production environments where stability and security are critical.

### 3.16 Shell Scripting

- Shell scripting involves writing scripts using shell commands to automate tasks and processes in a Linux environment.
- It is commonly used for system administration, data processing, and application deployment.

### 3.17 System Call

- A system call is a mechanism that allows user-space applications to request services from the kernel, such as file operations, process management, and network communication.
- Examples of system calls include open(), read(), write(), and fork().

### 3.18 Init System

- An init system is responsible for initializing the system during boot and managing system services and processes.
- Common init systems include System V init, Upstart, and systemd.

### 3.19 Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)

- The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) defines the directory structure and organization of files in a Linux operating system.
- It provides guidelines for where files and directories should be located, such as /bin for essential binaries and /etc for configuration files.

### 3.20 SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)

- SELinux is a security module for the Linux kernel that provides mandatory access control (MAC) policies to enhance system security.
- It helps prevent unauthorized access and limits the potential damage from security breaches by enforcing strict access controls.

### 3.21 LVM (Logical Volume Manager)

- LVM is a device-mapper framework that provides logical volume management for the Linux kernel.
- It allows for flexible disk management, including resizing, snapshotting, and spanning volumes across multiple physical disks.

### 3.22 GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader)

- GRUB is a bootloader used to load and manage multiple operating systems on a computer.
- It provides a menu interface during system startup, allowing users to select which operating system to boot.
